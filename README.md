# WeatherApp

A software program known as a weather app gives users access to the most recent weather data for one or more places. 
It makes use of information from weather forecasting agencies and presents it in a user-friendly way so users may keep updated about 
the weather now and in the future. A weather app's main goal is to give users reliable, real-time weather information, 
such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and forecasts for various time frames. 

Using OpenWeather, I created this weather application. A software program that uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data is 
referred to as a weather app employing OpenWeather and offers consumers precise and current weather information. Popular weather data 
supplier OpenWeather provides a variety of weather data and forecasting services.

The weather app using OpenWeather typically includes the following features:

1. Current Weather: The app displays the current weather conditions for a specific location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed.

2. Location Search: Users can search for weather information for a specific location. They can enter a city name to retrieve weather data for that location. 

3. Multiple Locations: Users can save and manage multiple locations within the app. This feature allows them to easily switch between
   different locations and view their respective weather conditions.
